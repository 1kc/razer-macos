## FAQ

Q: Selecting a colour setting has no effect on my keyboard.

A: It is possible that a wrong on-board keyboard profile has been selected. Change to a different profile and try again. See your device manual for specific instructions on how to switch profiles.

Q: Menu says "No device found".

A: Use the "Refresh Device List" option.

## Developer usage

Ensure xcode command line tools are installed and if building for arm64, a valid Developer ID Application certificate as only notarized apps will run by default. In order to run unsigned and/or unnotarized apps on Apple Silicon, you will need to boot into 1TR (One True Recovery) and run `bputil -n` to downgrade security to permissive.

Install node package dependencies:

    yarn

Run development server:

    yarn dev

During development, every time the driver code has been updated, a rebuild is required:

    yarn rebuild

For building a signed distribution ready app and dmg:

    Edit release.sh to include your Apple Developer ID username and app specific password.

    `./release.sh`

    The script will display instructions to check notarization status as well as instructions to staple the notarization ticket once approved by Apple.

    Once approved by Apple, run `./dmg.sh` to generate a dmg.

## Implementation

Project includes both hardware drivers and user interface.

Drivers are ported from the [openrazer](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer) project for Linux.
The goal is to support all devices from openrazer on macOS.

An Electron macOS menu bar app is used for the user interface.
The C driver is exposed as a native Node.js addon using node-addon-api, which gets invoked by Electron at runtime to send packets to devices.

Adding support for new peripherals types requires porting from the openrazer project. See [wiki](https://github.com/1kc/razer-macos/wiki).
